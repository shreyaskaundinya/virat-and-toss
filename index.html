<title>hello hello toss the coin you will</title>



<body>
    <div class="container">
        Virat has a 45% toss win percentage in tests.
        <br>
        In ODIs it is 42%
        <br>
        In t20Is it is as low as 40%
        <br>
        In IPL its kind of okayish at 47%
        <br>
        The thing is he does not win many tosses, in most of the pitches toss does not really affect the game, but there
        are certain scenarios where it does, also in clutch situations like knockout its better to win the toss than
        lose it.
        <br>
        But how can you win every single toss? I have an idea which is the most stupid, impractical and nonsense idea of
        all time
        but
        its fun though.
        <br>
        The idea is we can probably use Quantum Teleportaion. We need to somehow entangle the person who calls the toss
        and
        coin
        and if the person calling it is Virat we will ensure it results in the same outcome and if its the opposition
        captain we
        will make the coin give a different outcome.
        You can check out the Qiskit textbook on <a
            href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/teleportation.html">Quantum
            Teleportaion</a> its awesome. This is just a fun simulation showing how no matter who is calling it,
        Virat will always win the toss.
        <br>
        Now for me the most important toss Virat is supposed to win is the WTC final one and I do not know who will be
        calling
        it, but I will cover for both scenarios. Who is calling the toss?<br>
